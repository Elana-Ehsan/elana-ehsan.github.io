<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am **Ziyi Guo (ÈÉ≠Â≠êÊØÖ)**, an undergraduate student at **Wuhan University, Hongyi Honor College**, majoring in **Microelectronics Science & Engineering (EE)** (GPA: 3.94/4.00, ranked 2/55).  

In **Spring 2025**, I studied at **UC Berkeley** through the Berkeley International Study Program, and since **Summer 2025**, I have been conducting research on **energy-efficient SoC accelerators for generative AI** at **Duke University**, supervised by [Prof. Yiran Chen](https://ece.duke.edu/people/yiran-chen/) and [Dr. Changchun Zhou](https://changchun-zhou.github.io/).  

My research interests include: 
- Digital IC Design  
- Energy-efficient AI accelerators (SoC/ASIC) 

<strong style="color:red;">I am actively looking for PhD opportunities in Fall 2026.</strong>
